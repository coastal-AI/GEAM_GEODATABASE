### Info
Welcome to the GEAM geodatabase, which contains a comprehensive collection of spatial data gathered through fieldwork by our group. This geodatabase supports research into seagrass ecosystems, providing valuable datasets for analysis, validation, and further investigations.

### Contents
The geodatabase contains the following datasets:

- **Monitoring Stations**: Georeferenced point locations of sampling sites where seagrass meadow parameters are routinely assesed, providing a consistent spatial framework for long-term monitoring and environmental assessments.
- **Groundtruth Data**: Field observations collected to validate remote sensing outputs, essential for confirming species presence or absence and identifying cover types.
- **Drone Surveys**: High-resolution aerial imagery acquired through drone flights, used to map and monitor seagrass meadows.
- **Underwater Video Transects**: Georeferenced video recordings captured along underwater transects, supporting the analysis of seagrass distribution limits and coverage.


### Funding
Data displayed in the viewer has been collected as part of various initiatives:

- **POSINET Project:** A long-term monitoring network for Posidonia oceanica meadows and climate change in the Region of Murcia (2004–2020). The project was funded by the Fisheries and Aquaculture Service of the Directorate-General for Livestock and Fisheries (Ministry of Agriculture, Water, and the Environment of the Autonomous Community of the Region of Murcia), with support from the European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund (EMFAF), and co-financed by the Spanish Institute of Oceanography (IEO).

- **ESMARES2 project:** entrusted to the Spanish Institute of Oceanography (IEO-CSIC), by the Directorate-General for the Coast and the Sea of the Ministry for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge (MITERD) of the Spanish Government for the implementation of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) in Spanish waters (2019-2024).

- **BIODIV project:** “Scientific and technical support for the monitoring of marine biodiversity: state-jurisdiction marine protected areas and species (2022-2025).” The project is funded by the European Union – NextGenerationEU through the Recovery, Transformation, and Resilience Plan, and is promoted by the Directorate-General for Biodiversity, Forests, and Desertification of the Ministry for Ecological Transition and Demographic Challenge, and the CSIC, through the Spanish Institute of Oceanography (IEO).

- **ESMARES3 project:** "Monitoring of the Marine Strategies, Marine Environment Assessment, and Definition of Good Environmental Status (2024-2025)". The project is carried out by the IEO-CSIC as part of the Interdepartmental Collaboration Agreement between the Ministry for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge and the Ministry of Science, Innovation, and Universities. It is co-funded by the European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund.


### Data requests
The GEODATABASE displays only the metadata for each entry.  We are in the process of finalizing our data-sharing policy, and in the interim, access to detailed data associated with these locations is unavailable. For further inquiries, please contact us at jaime.bernardeau@ieo.csic.es.
