# GEAM Geodatabase  

Welcome to the GEAM Geodatabase repository, which contains a comprehensive collection of spatial data gathered through fieldwork and remote sensing efforts. This geodatabase supports research into seagrass ecosystems, providing valuable datasets for analysis, validation, and further investigations.

## Contents

The geodatabase includes the following datasets:

- **Groundtruth Data**: Field-collected observations that validate and support remote sensing studies, essential for confirming species presence and environmental conditions.
- **Drone Surveys**: High-resolution aerial imagery captured through drone surveys to map and monitor seagrass meadows across various locations.
- **Underwater Video Transects**: Georeferenced underwater video footage documenting seagrass distribution, which aids in analyzing seagrass health and coverage.
- **Sampling Stations**: Georeferenced coordinates for repeated sampling events, providing a spatial framework for long-term monitoring and environmental assessments.

## Usage

This repository is designed for researchers, environmental scientists, and collaborators working on seagrass ecosystems or related fields. It provides a preview of spatial datasets that can be used for:

- **Analysis**: Use the data to perform spatial analyses and modeling.
- **Validation**: Validate remote sensing data or other geospatial models.
- **Investigation**: Support investigations into seagrass ecology, monitoring, and conservation efforts.
