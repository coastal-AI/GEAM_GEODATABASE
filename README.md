# Coastal Drone Metadata Map

This platform is a joint initiative involving multiple institutions working with drones for coastal habitat mapping. Its primary goal is to provide insights into areas where drone flights have already been conducted, helping to prevent duplication of efforts. This collaborative metadata map displays information from photogrammetric drone flights, offering users access to flight dates, spatial extents, and other relevant data. Previews of orthomosaics captured during these flights are also available, though the full orthomosaics are not provided here. To request access to the complete orthomosaics, please contact the listed representative.

All metadata and orthomosaic previews are shared under the [CC BY-NC 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/deed.en). Contributing institutions retain the right to determine the terms for sharing the full orthomosaics, including the relevant licensing conditions.
