# GEAM Geodatabase  

Welcome to the GEAM Geodatabase repository, which contains a comprehensive collection of spatial data gathered through fieldwork and remote sensing efforts. This geodatabase supports research into seagrass ecosystems, providing valuable datasets for analysis, validation, and further investigations.

## Contents

The geodatabase includes the following datasets:

- **Groundtruth Data**: Field-collected observations that validate and support remote sensing studies, essential for confirming species presence and environmental conditions.
- **Drone Surveys**: High-resolution aerial imagery captured through drone surveys to map and monitor seagrass meadows across various locations.
- **Underwater Video Transects**: Georeferenced underwater video footage documenting seagrass distribution, which aids in analyzing seagrass health and coverage.
- **Sampling Stations**: Georeferenced coordinates for repeated sampling events, providing a spatial framework for long-term monitoring and environmental assessments.
